Heading Anchors
===============

Heading Anchors is a self-contained, library-agnostic chunk of JavaScript code that creates and handles "¶" anchors for headings on a web page.


Browser support
---------------

Heading Anchors works in the browsers you care about, that is, IE9 and all others.


Known issues
------------

- Just a test.
- There currently are some quirks in Firefox. Both 3.6 and 4.0. Go figure…
- <del>Actually, creation of anchors is working but "handling" isn’t yet. By "handling" I mean scrolling at the right heading at the first load of the page.</del> <ins>Now it does!</ins>
